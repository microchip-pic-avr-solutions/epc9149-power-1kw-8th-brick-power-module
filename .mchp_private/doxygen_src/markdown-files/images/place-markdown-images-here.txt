The main index of the online help output ned to be established manually by defining groups. 
Each group will be a index. Groups can point to each other to establish a tree structure
under which documentation pages can be sorted.

Example:

@defgroup group1 Index1 Level 1

@defgroup group1.1 Index1 Level 2
@ingroup group1

@defgroup group2 Index2 Level 1


will result in a tree structure looking like this:


  +-[Index1 Level 1]
  |     |
  |     |
  |     +-[Index1 Level 2]
  |
  |
  +-[Index2 Level 1]
