# 
# Description:
# These project-specific settings will overwrite and/or extend default settings 
# declared in the doxyfile template configuration, where tags assigned with '=' 
# will overwrite the original setting while tags assigned with '+=' will extend 
# the default settings specified in the doxyfile template configuration.
# 
# doxyfile template location: .mchp_private/doxygen_src/templates

# 1) Project Information

PROJECT_NAME        = "EPC9149 1 kW LLC 8th Brick Size Power Module"
PROJECT_NUMBER      = 
PROJECT_BRIEF       = "4:1 Voltage Transformer Module (VTM) Firmware"

# 2) Project File Location and Path Declarations
#
# a) Input Files
#
# 	 Description:
#	 The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
#	 documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
#	 directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
#	 spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
#	 Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT               += ../../../EPC9149-REV1.X/sources

# b) Include File Path Reference 
#
# 	 Description:
#	 The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
#	 path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
#	 header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
#	 the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
#	 specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
#	 using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH = ../../../EPC9149-REV1.X/sources

# b) General File Path Reference 
#
# 	 Description:
#	 The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
#	 Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
#	 part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
#	 If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
#	 strip.
#
#	 Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
#	 will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
#	 This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH     = ../../../

# 3) Pre-Definitions of common macros, which are not visible to the doxygen parser
#    (e.g. XC16 C-Compiler macros defined in MPLAB X project properties
#
#	 Description:
# 	 The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
#	 defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
#	 gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
#	 name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
#	 is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
#	 recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
#	 This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED          += __attribute__(x)=
PREDEFINED			+= __epc9149_r32__

# 4) File extensions of file types which should be included in the documentation 
#    in addition to the common file types of embedded C programs. Predefined
# 	 file types are *.c, *.h, *.s, *.S, *.inc, *.dox, *.md 
#    Add any additional file extension pattern as needed here
#
#    Description:
#	 If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
#	 FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wild-card patterns (like *.cpp and
#	 *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories.
#
#	 Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
#	 need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
#	 read by doxygen.
#
#	 Note the list of default checked file patterns might differ from the list of
#	 default file extension mappings (see above).

# 	 Example: FILE_PATTERNS       += *.txt

FILE_PATTERNS		+=

# 5) Exclude files and/or directories from being parsed and included in documentation 
#    These settings must be used to exclude markdown files of subtree repositories to
#    prevent conflicts with in-code declarations
# 
# 	 Description:
# 	 The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# 	 excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# 	 subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# 	 Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# 	 run.

EXCLUDE					+= ../../../EPC9149-REV1.X/sources/fault_handler/drivers/README.md
EXCLUDE					+= ../../../EPC9149-REV1.X/sources/common/p33c_pral/README.md

# 6) Add macros for section definitions if @cond or @if condition tags are used 
#
#	 Description:
# 	 The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional documentation
# 	 sections, marked by \if <section_label> ... \endif and \cond <section_label>
# 	 ... \endcond blocks.
#
#	 Example:
# 	 ENABLED_SECTIONS        += INCLUDE_BOOST
# 	 ENABLED_SECTIONS        += INCLUDE_LCD

ENABLED_SECTIONS       =


# END OF FILE
